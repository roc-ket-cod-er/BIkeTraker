## 10/8/2025 - BRAINSTORMING pt1  

I brainstormed about how this project would go. As it stands right now, I have a few options, but I don't really know how to do it.

What I am thinking about doing is having it all in some king of enclosure, with a main board, GPS, and some kind of Cellular Module. The problem is, I need to have proper battery that has sufficient charge and stuff, and I need to find a good cellular module. I was thinking of having one PCB do it all, but I don't really know how I am going to do it.

I did some research, and I am thinking that I should use the module in this image:

But other options I have found are this thing called Simbase,

And I am sort of thinking of using it with a normal cellular module, maybe one from waveshare:
