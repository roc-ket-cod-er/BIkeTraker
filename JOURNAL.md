## 10/8/2025 - More Research: Blues & Waveshare Cellular.  

I went around looking for other providers of cellular service, and I came across this thing called "Blues" and they also provide cellular and stuff. The one small problem is, after looking all through there documentation, the cost is still waaay too high:

So umm. That was a waste of an hour...

I also took a look at WaveShare's cellular offerings, and they took looking pretty cool!:

Just one problem. The documentation is really hurting my brain. I am actually pretty stuck because I don't know if I should just go for using Particle IO, as that seemed to be the easiest to set up, or I could go the polar opposite and completely custom design a PCB that has build in cellular. I sort of do want it to be custom, but it would be sooo much easier to use Particle's Boron...

A bit later:

Brooooo I am still stuck :((((((

I still have no idea how I am going to do this. Ideally I'd just make a board and hope for the best...

I am sort of leaning towards using a fully custom setup...
  

## 10/9/2025 - BRAINSTORMING pt1  

I brainstormed about how this project would go. As it stands right now, I have a few options, but I don't really know how to do it.

What I am thinking about doing is having it all in some king of enclosure, with a main board, GPS, and some kind of Cellular Module. The problem is, I need to have proper battery that has sufficient charge and stuff, and I need to find a good cellular module. I was thinking of having one PCB do it all, but I don't really know how I am going to do it.

I did some research, and I am thinking that I should use the module in this image:

But other options I have found are this thing called Simbase,

And I am sort of thinking of using it with a normal cellular module, maybe one from waveshare.
